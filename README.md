# Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction
The project aims to analyze customer churn in a telecommunications company and develop predictive models to identify at-risk customers. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights and recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
Task 1: Data Preparation
Description:
In this task, you will be responsible for loading the dataset and conducting an initial exploration. Handle missing values, and if necessary, convert categorical variables into numerical representations. Furthermore, split the dataset into training and testing sets for subsequent model evaluation.
Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Description:
Calculate and visually represent the overall churn rate. Explore customer distribution by gender, partner status, and dependent status. Analyze tenure distribution and its relation with churn. Investigate how churn varies across different contract types and payment methods.
Task 3: Customer Segmentation
Description:
Segment customers based on tenure, monthly charges, and contract type. Analyzechurn rates within these segments. Identify high-value customers who are at risk of churning and might need special attention.
Task 4: Churn Prediction Model
Description:
Choose suitable machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) forchurn prediction. Split data into training and testing sets, train and evaluate multiple models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Perform feature selection and hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Task 5: Model Evaluation and Interpretation
Description:
Evaluate the best predictive model using the testing dataset. Interpret model coefficients or feature importances to comprehend factors influencing churn. Create ROC curves and calculate AUC for model performance
assessment.
